# Getting Started

## Dependencies

The first dependencies are:

- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.4.4 as parent POM
- Starter Weblux + Reactor test

## Goal

This project's goal is to start working with Reactor and Spring Webflux. 

### What to do

Update the code step by step following the instruction. Each step leaves in a different branch of this repo.

#### Plot

You are working in a garden center to sell Trees, Bamboos and other plants. This place is composed of 3 Greenhouses, one for each type of plants. Each `greenhouse` is divided into `rows` to let the customer brows your products. And to maintain the good health of your plants you have installed dripping system all over the place. Every `dropper` is _connected_ and sends a signal on every drip it releases.

We are going to analyse this information flow.

#### Step 1

Fill the `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.DripIrrigation.followDrops` function to make the associated Unit Test runs successfully.

#### Step 2

<<<<<<< HEAD
Then complete the `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.DripIrrigation.followDropper` and `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.producer.GreenHouseProducer.getDrops` functions to make the associated Unit Test runs successfully.

Then complete the `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.DripIrrigation.followDropper` and `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.producer.GreenHouseProducer.getDrops` functions to make the associated Unit Test runs successfully.

#### Step 3

Next complete the `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.DripIrrigation.followDetailedDropper`, `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.DripIrrigation.getDetailedDrop` functions to make the associated Unit Test runs successfully.

#### Step 4

Then update the Dropper 3 from row 2 of the greenhouse 1 to mark it as broken. Then update the function `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.producer.GreenHouseProducer.buildDrop` to return an error whenever the Dropper is broken.Finally complete the `org.sixdouglas.formation.spring.irrigation.DripIrrigation.followDetailedDropperWithError`  functions to make the associated Unit Test runs successfully. And don't forget that other Unit Tests should continue to run successfully without being modified.
